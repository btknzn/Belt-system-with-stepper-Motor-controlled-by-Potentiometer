# Belt-system-with-stepper-Motor-controlled-by-Potentiometer

Project Aim: 
 We will ask user the location of stepper motor as angle of tours’ number under serial communication window between Arduino and Personal Computer. For instance, you enter 540 degree, ıt tours one and half tours.
Equipment List:
• PC 
• Arduino (Nano/Uno/Mega)
• Breadboard x 1 
• ETUKit x 1
• Stepper motor (Nema 200 steps) x 1
• LN298N motor driver
• Potentiometer

System Description and Mathematical Calculation:
 We know from our potentiometer, that one rotation has 60 seperated values because of it we will multiply with 6 to calculate one tour in potentiometer. For example, 
 we entered 720 degree, we count 2 tours in our potentiometer.
